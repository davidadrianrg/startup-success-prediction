# Startup Success Prediction
Machine Learning algorithm to model the probability that a Startup company is successfull and decide if it would be advisable to invest in it.

## DataSet
The DataSet used to fit the machine learning models can be found here, [Startup Success Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/manishkc06/startup-success-prediction).

## Installation
In order to run the main program properly it is needed to take a look at the following libraries and be sure there are already installed.

You can use the pip command to install them easily through command window.

### Basics
This packages may be well known and should be installed in your python environment by default.
- NumPy
```bash
pip install numpy
```
- pandas
```bash
pip install pandas
```
### Also needed
The following libraries are also required:

- matplotlib
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
- seaborn
```bash
pip install seaborn
```
- scipy
```bash
pip install scipy
```

- scikit-learn

There are different ways to install ```scikit-learn```,  before moving to the installation, it requires the following:
- Python version 3.5 or higher
- NumPy version 1.11.0 or higher
- SciPy version 0.17.0 or higher
joblib 0.11 or higher.

And then:

```bash
pip install -U scikit-learn
``` 
For more information check [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html).

- tensorflow
  
Now it is also necessary the ```TensorFlow``` library:
 
```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

For more information check [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install?hl=es-419).

- keras

And finally, ```keras```:
```bash
pip install keras
```
